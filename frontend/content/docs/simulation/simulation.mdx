## Crate Simulations
The instructions on creating simulations are in <Link href="/docs/simulation/simulation-manage#create-simulation">Create Simulation</Link>. 

## Run Simulation
![A webpage with a big table in the middle.](/docs/SimulationRun.PNG)
To run a simulation, you will need to. 
1. Find the simulation you are looking for at `/simulation`
2. Click the three ellipses. Then click "Run"

You will now be at the simulation page. You can see the console log updating at real time. Once the simulation is finished, you may click on the "Back" button to return. 

<Callout title="Premature Exit" type="warn">
	If you exit the simulation before it ends. The simulation will stil run. However, at this point there is no way to read the logs from existing runs. 
</Callout>

## Analyse Results
You may analyse the results from the exported files under your favourite tools. 

<Callout title="New Function">
  New functionality will be out later to integrate simulation and data analsis under one house.
